Parameters
----------

auth (optional)
  Authentication parameters. Can define each of them with ENV as well.

  | **type**: dict

  api_key (optional)
    The API key that should be used when authenticating. If this is not set, the value of the SENSU_API_KEY environment variable will be checked.

    This replaces *auth.user* and *auth.password* parameters.

    For more information about the API key, refer to the official Sensu documentation at https://docs.sensu.io/sensu-go/latest/guides/use-apikey-feature/.

    | **type**: str

  ca_path (optional)
    Path to the CA bundle that should be used to validate the backend certificate.

    If this parameter is not set, module will use the CA bundle that python is using.

    It is also possible to set this parameter via the *SENSU_CA_PATH* environment variable.

    | **type**: path

  password (optional)
    The Sensu user's password. If this is not set the value of the SENSU_PASSWORD environment variable will be checked.

    This parameter is ignored if the *auth.api_key* parameter is set.

    | **type**: str
    | **default**: P@ssw0rd!

  url (optional)
    Location of the Sensu backend API. If this is not set the value of the SENSU_URL environment variable will be checked.

    | **type**: str
    | **default**: http://localhost:8080

  user (optional)
    The username to use for connecting to the Sensu API. If this is not set the value of the SENSU_USER environment variable will be checked.

    This parameter is ignored if the *auth.api_key* parameter is set.

    | **type**: str
    | **default**: admin

  verify (optional)
    Flag that controls the certificate validation.

    If you are using self-signed certificates, you can set this parameter to ``false``.

    ONLY USE THIS PARAMETER IN DEVELOPMENT SCENARIOS! In you use self-signed certificates in production, see the *auth.ca_path* parameter.

    It is also possible to set this parameter via the *SENSU_VERIFY* environment variable.

    | **type**: bool
    | **default**: True


name (required)
  The Sensu resource's name. This name (in combination with the namespace where applicable) uniquely identifies the resource that Ansible operates on.

  If the resource with selected name already exists, Ansible module will update it to match the specification in the task.

  Consult the *name* metadata attribute specification in the upstream docs on https://docs.sensu.io/sensu-go/latest/reference/ for more details about valid names and other restrictions.

  | **type**: str

rules (optional)
  Rules that the cluster role applies.

  Must be non-empty if *state* is ``present``.

  | **type**: list

  resource_names (optional)
    Names of specific resources the rule has permission to access.

    Note that for the ``create`` verb, this argument will not be taken into account when enforcing RBAC, even if it is provided.

    | **type**: list

  resources (required)
    Types of resources the rule has permission to access.

    | **type**: list

  verbs (required)
    Permissions to be applied by the rule.
